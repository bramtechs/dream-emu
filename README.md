# Game-dev projects 
work-in-progress video games written in c++ with [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib), relying on an ECS kind of system.

## Compilation + Running
using *Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022*

```bat
git clone https://github.com/bramtechs/dream-emu.git
cd dream-emu/forge
forge.bat runrel
```
> Note: If release builds crash for some reason, try building with debug:

```
forge.bat run
```

## TODO
- [ ] Dream emulator (some small 3d game to develop my library around)
- [ ] Temple Mayhem (some small 2d game to develop my library around)
- [ ] Space Game (the rpg that will never be done)
